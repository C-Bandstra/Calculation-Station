# Calculation Station

## Abstract

I was given a code challenge that asked me to build a calculator web app. The calculator had to have basic math functionality that displays the results of user's inputted calculation. The app also needed a space to display any calculations created by user's. This display space needed to be able to showcase all user calculations in close to real-time.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Fetch
- CSS

## Try out the deployed app!

## Added Features/Technologies

Shadow Result - The calculator gives you a hint on what your calculation will equal, without having to click the "=" button.

[Node/Express API](https://github.com/C-Bandstra/Calculation-Station-API) - Designed my own simple REST API which allows me to store the user calculations and display them across the board.

## Looking Ahead

After completing the MVP for this project and looking at it now, I would love to add a more responsive design which allows consistency from web to mobile. Adding a little more refined styling would be a close second.


## In case things go wrong!

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
